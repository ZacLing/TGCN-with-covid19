# TGCN-with-covid19
This project employs graph methods to predict and analyze the spread of the Covid-19 virus in the United States based on confirmed cases. The dataset's latitude and longitude data for each state in the United States are transformed into a graph structure with states as nodes and distances between them as edges. The graph structure is optimized using a pruning method. This project introduces a Temporal Graph Convolution Network (TGCN) that combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM). GCN captures spatial information within each graph, while LSTM captures temporal information across multiple graphs. In the experimental phase, this project compares the performance of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and regular LSTM methods. Furthermore, utilizing the node embeddings generated by the TGCN model, the project provides link predictions for the virus spread between different states within the United States by calculating correlation coefficients.
